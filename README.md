# Dolphin-Attack 🐬🏴‍☠️

This game was created for CS 4483 at Western University by [Justin Weller](https://github.com/Justin-Weller), [Connor Haines](https://github.com/connor2033), [Finn Ferguson](https://github.com/finn00dev), and [Zakir Jiwani](https://github.com/ZakirJ). See the original game pitch [here](CS4483IndividualGamePitch-JustinWeller.pdf).

## Features

Dolphin-Attack is a 2D endless wave survival game where you play as a Pirate fighting to protect his ship from evil attack-dolphins!

- Select your character and a nickname on the character selection screen
- Run **[W, A, S, D]**, Jump **[Space]**, Drop through platforms **[S+Jump]**, and Dash **[Shift]** across your ship to avoid dolphins
- Watch your **health points** carefully on the **top corner** of the screen
- Kill dolphins by aiming your weapon with your **cursor** and firing with **left click**
- Overcome the **waves** as they increase in difficulty with more aggressive dolphins
- Collect extra health points from the **magic chest** at the end of each round
- Compare your best scores to your friends on the **leaderboard** screen

## Install & Run

Dolphin Attack was developed using the Unity game engine. The source code is in the folder "Dolphin-Attack" and the **executable file** is in the **"Build"** folder (named **"Dolphin Attack.exe"**). Launching this exe in the build folder will launch the game and bring you to the start menu of the game.

**NOTE:** Importing two asset packages (cited below) resulted in two folders which may contain scripts that we did not write or use. These folders are under "Dolphin Attack">Assets and we added "IMPORTED" at the start of their file names.
